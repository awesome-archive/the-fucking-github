## What

Do you have a lot of starred repositories and often need to look through them, but each time you need to open a new tab to enter `https://github.com` and click on the avatar on the right and click on `your stars`, then you can finally see your stars.

This is too cumbersome and it's a waste of time, fuck it!

Do you have some starred repositories, but their names are so complicated that you can't remember them, causing you to not search for them by name? Fuck it!

If you don't already have one, [create one](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,notifications,user&description=The%20Fucking%20Github%20browser%20extension), then copy and paste it into the token text box in the screen. Note that the minimal scopes that should be granted are `repo`, `notifications` and `user`.

**Warning**

If you have already started using it before version 1.3.1, please delete the TOKEN in use directly at the [personal access tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and regenerate it. See [#16](https://github.com/lvxianchao/the-fucking-github/issues/16)
